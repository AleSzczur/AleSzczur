## SOFTWARE TESTER - ALEKSANDRA SZCZUROWSKA

### <a name="aboutme">:mag_right: ABOUT ME</a>


Hi, I'm Ola! Some time ago, I decided to turn my professional life around. I like to acquire new knowledge, I am not afraid of challenges, I see what others do not notice and this is how I found my new career path as a software tester.

I am currently working at EGZOTech, a company that creates rehabilitation robots for people who, for some reason, have lost partial mobility of various parts of the body.

My participation in projects focuses on testing the website, which is designed to help clinics and physiotherapists in conducting rehabilitation of patients, including keeping a rehabilitation schedule, planning training and reporting rehabilitation progress on proprietary rehabilitation devices created by the company.
As part of my work, I perform manual and automatic tests in Cypress (functional, system, E2E, regression tests). In addition, I check the compatibility of the appearance of the website with mock-ups, report bug reports and information about the possibilities of improving functionality, which may be illegible from the user's point of view.

After hours, I continue to deepen my knowledge in the field of automated testing, API testing, and testing theory.
